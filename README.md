# Project Euler: JavaScript

A repository for my project euler solutions. While using JS to solve these problems, my goal is to compose the solutions with higher order functions, designed to be highly reusable. I wanted to practice adding a "flavor" of functional programming, although I'm not going to adhere to it purely. For example, I'm using for/while loops all over the place.
